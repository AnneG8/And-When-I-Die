I'm not scared of dying
I don't really care
If there's peace you find in dying
Well then, let the time be near

If there's peace you find in dying
And if dying time is here
You just bundle up my coffin
'Cause it's cold way down there
Said it's cold way down there,
Said it's crazy cold, down there

And when I die, 
When I'm gone
There'll be, one child born
In this world to carry on,
And when I die, 
When I'm dead and gone
There'll be, one child born 
In this world to carry on.
