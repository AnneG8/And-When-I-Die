I'm not scared of dying
I don't really care
If there's peace you find in dying
Well then, let the time be near

If there's peace you find in dying
And if dying time is here
You just bundle up my coffin
'Cause it's cold way down there
Said it's cold way down there,
Said it's crazy cold, down there

And when I die, 
When I'm gone
There'll be, one child born
In this world to carry on,
And when I die, 
When I'm dead and gone
There'll be, one child born 
In this world to carry on.

Now troubles, there are many
They're as deep as a well
I can swear there ain't no heaven
But I pray there ain't no hell
Oh I swear there ain't no heaven
But I'll pray there ain't no hell

But I'll never know by livin'
Only dyin' time will tell
Yeah, my dyin' time will tell
Said my dyin' time will tell

And when I die, 
When I'm gone
There'll be one child born 
In this world to carry on
When I die, 
When I'm dead and gone
There'll be one child born 
In this world to carry on.

Don't want to go by devil
Don't want to go by demon
Don't want to go by Satan
Just let me go. 

(Don't want to go...)Ñ…3
Just let me go...
